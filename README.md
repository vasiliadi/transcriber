Transcriber &amp; translator for audio files. Like Otter.ai but open-source and almost free.

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Otter.ai

[Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/pricing) monthly subscription is **\$16.99**/per user. \
Where you get:
> 1200 monthly transcription minutes; 90 minutes per conversation

## The Transcriber app

**Transcription**:
[Replicate AI models cloud-hosting](https://replicate.com/pricing) with current prices and models used, 1200 minutes will cost approximately **\$1.60 - \$5.50** \
At least three times cheaper with the same or even better quality of transcription, in my opinion. \
And you pay as you go.

**Translation (summarization is depricated[^1], use [vasiliadi/ai-summarizer-telegram-bot](https://github.com/vasiliadi/ai-summarizer-telegram-bot))**:
[Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) is **free**, if you use Gemini API **from a project that has billing disabled**, without the benefits available in paid plan.

**Hosting**:
Free tires or trials of [Render](https://render.com/pricing), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free), [Orcale Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services), [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free), or low-cost [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), or any you like.

**Total**:[^2] \
Pay as you go for 10 hours audio. \
Replicate with `whisper-diarization` + free Gemini API + DigitalOcean = \$2.00 + \$0.00 + \$0.10 = **\$2.10** \
Replicate with `incredibly-fast-whisper` + free Gemini API + DigitalOcean = \$0.70 + \$0.00 + \$0.10 = **\$0.80**

## Technical details

[Run Whisper model on Replicate](https://replicate.com/openai/whisper) much cheaper than using [OpenAI API for Whisper](https://openai.com/pricing).

I use three models:

[vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper](https://replicate.com/vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper) best for speed \
[thomasmol/whisper-diarization](https://replicate.com/thomasmol/whisper-diarization) best for dialogs \
[openai/whisper](https://replicate.com/openai/whisper) best in accuracy

### Limitations

#### OpenAI Whisper model

[OpenAI Speech to text Whisper model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text)

> File uploads are currently limited to 25 MB.

To avoid this limitation, I use compression (Even though I know the models I'm using use compression, too. In practice, I've encountered a limit when relying on compression in a model). The file size without compression is 63 MB for 45 minutes of audio. However, after compression, the file size reduces to 4 MB for the same duration. Therefore, using compression, we can avoid splitting audio into chunks, and we can increase the limit to approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes of audio without losing transcription quality.

But if you still need to transcript more you can split file using [pydub's](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/blob/master/API.markdown) `silence.split_on_silence()` or `silence.detect_silence()` or `silence.detect_nonsilent()`. This function's speed is hardware-dependent, but it is about 10 times faster than listening to the entire file.

In my tests, I face three main problems:

1. These functions are not working as I expect.
2. If split just by time, you can cut in the middle of a word.
3. Post-processing becomes a challenge. It's hard to identify the speaker smoothly. Loss of timestamps.

All this beloongs to very long audio only.

#### Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash

[Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash model names and properties](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models)

> Max output tokens: 8,192

0.75 words per token = ~6,144 words or about 35 minutes of speaking. But for [non-English languages](https://mor10.com/openai-token-tax/), most words are counted as two or more tokens.

The maximum number of tokens for output is currently 8,192. Audio post-processing, which includes correction and translation, can only be done for files that are approximately 35 minutes long. Other models have a maximum output of 4,096 or less. If you need to process more than 8,192 tokens, you may need to do it in batches, but this will significantly increase the processing time.

Translation by chunks still works, but the quality little bit lower.

> Max audio length: approximately 8.4 hours

~~It still works well for summarization.~~

> [2 queries per minute and 1000 per day for Gemini-1.5-pro. 15 and 1500 for Gemini-1.5-flash](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini#model-variations)

[Languages support](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models#language-support) for translation.

### Optional settings

#### HuggingFace.co

For diarization, all models rely on [pyannote.audio](https://huggingface.co/pyannote) solutions. As a developer, you must agree to the user conditions for accessing the models offered by pyannote. Therefore, it is necessary to accept the user conditions for [pyannote/segmentation-3.0](https://hf.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0) and [pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1](https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) and obtain the [HuggingFace API token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

The [thomasmol/whisper-diarization](https://replicate.com/thomasmol/whisper-diarization) model also uses the same models for diarization, but the developer uses his own HuggingFace API token. This means that an additional token is not required.

#### Text to Speach (depricated[^1])

By default, I use the [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) `eleven_turbo_v2_5` model to generate high-quality audio for summaries in various languages. It's very fast and 50% cheaper than the `eleven_multilingual_v2` model. You get 10,000 credits per month for free, which is about 15 generated audios. If you need more, you'll need to purchase a [plan](https://elevenlabs.io/pricing) or use [OpenAI TTS](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/).

[OpenAI TTS](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) is pay as you go service, which costs $0.015 / 1K characters. \
OpenAI's **input is limited** to a maximum of 4096 characters. To overcome this limitation, I split the text into chunks using [semantic_text_splitter](https://github.com/benbrandt/text-splitter) and [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/).

Additionally, the [xtts-v2](https://replicate.com/lucataco/xtts-v2) model is another high-quality multilanguage model, but [Coqui](https://coqui.ai/), the developer of this model, is shutting down. As a result, I use ElevenLabs or OpenAI.

### Config

Example of `.env` file:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_api_key"
HF_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_api_key" # only for incredibly-fast-whisper model with enabled diarization
PROXY="" # only if you need to use proxy
```

**All keys are mandatory**, but you can fill some of them with the wrong key to complete the function. Using functions that require a specific key filled with the incorrect key will result in an error.

You need to replace the path to the env_file in `compose.yaml`

[Get Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/) \
[Get Replicate API token](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens) \
[Get HF API tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and don't forget to accept [pyannote/segmentation-3.0](https://hf.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0) and [pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1](https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) user conditions. Needed only for `incredibly-fast-whisper` model with enabled diarization.

## PS

Your transcription and [Google NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) is very powerfull tool. \
Using [context caching](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Caching.ipynb), you can ask ton of questions about the topic.
